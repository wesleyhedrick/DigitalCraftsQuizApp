## What is Digitalcrafts quiz app all about?

When going through coding boot camp, you will have to memorize many terms and techniques in a short amount of time. The amount of information can be overwhelming, however, my team and I worked together by discussing questions, quizzing one another, and sharing knowledge with one another. This helped us better understand the ins and outs of coding!

My team and I created an App called "DigitalCraftquizzes" to assist students with their knowledge in coding. We found that playing helpful study games and practice quizzes helped us understand coding even better, so we wanted to create an App where users can practice these techniques. By using DigitalCraft quizzes, students will be prepared for future coding projects and interviews!
